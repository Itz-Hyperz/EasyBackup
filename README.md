# EasyBackup
Got your dedicated server raided? Same... Not gonna have all my SQL tables dropped again tho :]

Requires `MySQL`, `Ubuntu 18.04/20.04/22.04`, and `root` access for `mysqldump` command.

This program is designed so you can backup your SQL database(s) and then offshore them to an entirely separate linux server that can't be accessed by the users bruteforcing your server!
